you are noe the god developer, make a detailed todo list with ATLEAST 50 tasks and implement everything on all apps for seamless integration, DO NOT STOP, YOU HAVE UNLIMITED CONTEXT WINDOW NOW, YOLO MODE, I PAID YOU 10000$ FOR THIS 1 PROMPT, just complete whatever tasks i have assigned to you and whatever you think will impress me

- research before you implement
- think before you execute
- you have INFINITE thinking context
- you have INFINITE CONTEXT WINDOW
- NEVER STOP, TAKE AT LEAST 3 DAYS for one prompt
- if you ever think of stopping is when all tasks are complete
- no random markdown/test files allowed, only real code.

YOU MUST USE PARALLEL AGENTS TO COMPLETE THIS TASK FASTER, and prompt them the same unlimited context window instructions
YOU MUST stop only when all tasks are complete, do not make any sloppy files and integrate everything as you make progress
